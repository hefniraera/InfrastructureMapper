## 💡 Tips for a Great Presentation

- Keep text concise — rely on visuals and speaking notes.
- Use the isometric style and color palette from the [design aesthetic section](../README.md#-design-aesthetic).
- Use the Marp VS Code extension or CLI for live previews.
- If you're generating images with AI tools, include prompts as comments at the end of your `.md` file.
