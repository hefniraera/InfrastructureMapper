## 👩‍💻 About Me

- Intern at **Kartoza**
- Bachelor of Engineering, majored in Geodetic Engineering
- Currently exploring GIS with a growing interest in open-source GIS. Passionate about GIS and map styling.
- Tools used: QGIS, QFieldCloud, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, VS Code, Marp, GitHub, etc.

## ❓ Analysis Problem

- How can we determine culinary facilities that are reachable within a specific travel time from a central point?
- Which culinary facilities that can be reached within 8 minutes and offer the best combination of **low price**, **high ratings**, specific **facilities** like Wi-Fi and indoor seating, and specific **category** like Cafe/Bakery? 

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

- A custom QGIS Model Designer diagram used for repeatable spatial processing.

## 🔬 Further Research

If I had more time, I would:

- Develop a specific travel mode for motorcycles to better represent real conditions, possibly using custom routing technology.
- Improve the model so users can select facilities and categories using dropdowns connected to the lookup table, ensuring updates are reflected automatically.
- Increase the study area and collect more data to improve the analysis
