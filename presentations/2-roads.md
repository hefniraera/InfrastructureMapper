## 👩‍💻 About Me

- Intern at **Kartoza**
- Background in spatial analysis
- Passionate about data-driven decision making, sustainable developement, and map design
- Tools used: QGIS, QFieldCloud, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, VS Code, Marp, GitHub, etc.

---

## 🧱 The Model

- The project uses a custom PostgreSQL/PostGIS schema  
- Diagram below shows the roads ERD:

## 💡 Insights

- Found 30 road segments (~5km total) that are in need of repair
- Found 3 road segments (~639m total) in desperate need of repair
- The local municipality should consider redoing the entirety of Burg Street

## 🔬 Further Research

If I had more time, I would:

- Use more advaced networking tools (pgRouting)
- Digitize bridge and speed bump features
- Increase the study area

---

## 🧳 My Internship Experience

### Highlights:

- ✅ Learned to use QGIS and a lot of other software/tools
- 🤝 Collaborated on a real project and gained practical experience
- 🎯 Gained confidence in presenting and communication
- 💬 Learned effectiver time management
